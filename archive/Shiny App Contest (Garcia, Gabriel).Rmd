## Purpose and Main Message

The LPI Growth Explorer is a way for users to look at how different countries improved or declined across key logistics performance indicators between 2007 and 2023. It shows which countries made progress in specific areas of their logistics systems and how those patterns differ across countries. The big idea is that the app lets users compare any two countries side by side. So if someone is doing a project on, say, the U.S. and China, or they just want quick statistics on infrastructure or customs growth, they can get that instantly.

The app focuses on the specific logistics components that matter to users, and originally it used checkboxes so people could include or exclude components as needed. It gives both a visual pattern and a quantitative summary of growth across selected components, which is useful for policy work, business analysis, or anyone trying to understand which countries are emerging in logistics or where the most improvement has happened.

I think interactivity is really important here because a static visualization would run into a lot of limitations. There are over 100 countries and six components, so showing every possible combination would require hundreds of charts and make it hard for anyone to find the comparisons they actually care about. Different users also need different comparisons. Someone in Europe might care about Germany versus the Netherlands, while a supply chain manager might care about Vietnam and Thailand. One static chart can’t do all that.

On top of that, some people only care about certain components, maybe just infrastructure or just timeliness, and a static chart would either force everything into one graphic or rely on arbitrary choices about what to include. Interactivity avoids that. The summary statistics also update dynamically, so users can get the exact growth rate for whatever combination of components they choose, whether that’s all six or just a subset like infrastructure and timeliness. In addition, allowing users to adjust the time window over which growth is measured changes the baseline years used in the percent change calculation itself, not just the visualization. Combined with the ability to switch country pairs, this turns the app into an exploratory tool where users can define their own comparisons across countries, components, and time, rather than being locked into a single predefined result.

For interactive features, the main ones are the two country dropdown menus, which make head-to-head comparison simple and intentional. Having two separate dropdowns is more intuitive than a multi-select setup. Then there’s the component selection (originally using checkboxes), which lets users include or exclude components depending on what they want to analyze. That makes the results more relevant to specific questions or lets people see whether growth is consistent across areas.

The bar chart shows side-by-side comparisons for each selected component, with clear color-coding so it’s easy to distinguish between countries. The summary statistic at the bottom calculates the average growth for each country across the selected components, which is useful for answering “Which country improved more overall?” in a single number.

To use the app, you pick your two countries, filter components if you want, and interpret the results. Taller bars mean more growth, and the summary shows the average growth across the components you selected. You can switch countries or components anytime to answer different questions.

All the data comes from the World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index. Missing data is filtered out automatically, and countries with incomplete observations are excluded so growth rates stay accurate.

Working on the project helped me understand the dataset more deeply because it made me think about which comparisons actually matter. A static visualization might show overall LPI scores or overall growth rates, but this app shows how a country can excel in one area (like infrastructure) and fall far behind in another (like customs), which highlights interesting policy imbalances. That nuance gets lost in static graphics.

Overall, this project helped me see how to build a visualization that can answer multiple questions from one dataset, which will be valuable for my final project and future data work.

I used generative AI tools (ChatGPT and Claude) to help me write the R code for this project, especially for the Shiny  structure, data wrangling , and some of the plotting syntax. I gave the models specific instructions based on the World Bank LPI dataset and then edited, debugged, and adapted the suggested code myself so that it would run correctly with my data and match the goals of the app.All final decisions about the code, analysis, and interpretation of the results are my own.

Prompts: 
"Why are all my change values showing NA after pivoting my LPI data from wide to long format and calculating percentage change between 2007 and 2023?"
"Identify and eliminate redundancies in my cleaning code where data is filtered, transformed, or pivoted multiple times when it could be done once."
"Clean up my Shiny server code to fix bars to display side-by-side instead of stacked."
"How can I simplify calculating percent change between two years for multiple variables without excessive pivoting and intermediate steps?"
"How do I add a dynamic text summary to my Shiny app that calculates and displays average percent change for the selected countries and components?"
"help me deploy it to shinyapps.io"
