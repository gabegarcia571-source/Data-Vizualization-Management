# CODE_MAPPING.md
**Goal of this file:** Provide a complete inventory of *every* executable R code chunk from the original project sources, and map each chunk to its destination script in the professional repository structure.

## Important note on the provided HTML files
I reviewed the three rendered HTML artifacts you provided:

- `Blog_Final_Project_2 (2).html` (Travel/Logistics)
- `TidyTuesdaySubmission.html` (Passport Power)
- `Shiny-App-Contest--Garcia,-Gabriel-.html` (Shiny documentation)

These HTML exports embed plots as images and contain narrative text, but they **do not contain the underlying R code as visible `<pre><code>` blocks** (i.e., the code is not directly extractable from the HTML markup).  

To achieve *perfect code replication* (your “code archaeologist” requirement), this mapping is therefore built from the original **.Rmd sources** that generated those HTML outputs, plus your **code archive Rmd** that contains the full TidyTuesday + Shiny implementation:

- `Blog_Final_Project_2.Rmd` → source for Travel/Logistics code
- `TidyTuesdayDecemberCodeArchive.Rmd` → source for Passport + Shiny app code
- `TidyTuesdaySubmission.Rmd` and `Shiny App Contest (Garcia, Gabriel).Rmd` are primarily narrative/writeups (minimal or no executable code).

Nothing below rewrites your logic — it is a chunk-by-chunk inventory and placement plan.
