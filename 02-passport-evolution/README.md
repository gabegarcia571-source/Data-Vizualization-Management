# Passport Power Evolution (TidyTuesday)

This folder reproduces your TidyTuesday passport analysis as written:
- data import + initial exploration
- “Historically weak passports” growth attempts + final visualization logic
- “Powerhouses” time-series comparison
- “Winners vs losers” framing and leaderboard logic

## Files
- `analysis.Rmd` — original source copied as-is
- `analysis.R` — extracted code chunks (1–37) with added section comments (logic unchanged)

## Data
Place the passport datasets into `data/`.
If `rank_by_year.csv` and `country_lists.csv` were provided, they are included here already.

## Outputs
Run the script to regenerate the static plots used in your write-up.
